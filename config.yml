# Input fastq files and sample metadata are specified in metadata/sample2runlib.csv. Edit this file accordingly.
# Note that entries in columns "run" + "library" together make up the primary key for fastq file location and each combination has to be unique.
# The paths to interleaved fastq input files are specified in column "il_fastq", otherwise in columns fq1 and fq2.
# Separate run/library combinations are joined into samples by identical entries in the "sample" column.

# sample sets are specified as *.txt files in metadata/samplesets.
# There can be several, the placeholder "all_samples" will trigger the respective rule to run on all samples from all files together.

# Specify the path(s) to your reference genome(s) and give them each a name.
